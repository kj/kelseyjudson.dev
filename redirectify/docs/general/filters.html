       <p>The <strong>Filters</strong> page in Redirectify allows you to prevent certain paths from showing up in your list based on matching patterns. This can be useful when you know that a path is irrelevant, and doesn’t need to be fixed. There are two types of pattern which you can toggle between; <strong>Wildcard</strong> and the more advanced <strong>Regexp</strong> (short for ‘regular expression’).</p>
       <h3 id="wildcard-filters">Wildcard filters</h3>
       <p>Wildcard filters are the easiest to use. They make use the ‘*’ character as a wildcard matching any string of text. For example, the filter</p>
       <pre><code>/collections/*/products/t-shirt</code></pre>
       <p>-would match each of the following paths:</p>
       <pre><code>/collections/men/products/t-shirt
       /collections/women/products/t-shirt
       /collections/kids/products/t-shirt</code></pre>
       <p>The filter</p>
       <pre><code>/collections/kids/products/*</code></pre>
       <p>-would match any product under the given collection.</p>
       <p>Wildcard filters must match the full path from beginning to end, so the filter <code>products/*</code> would not match any path, but the filter <code>*/products/*</code> may.</p>
       <h3 id="regexp-filters">Regexp filters</h3>
       <p>Regular expressions are very powerful, but quite a complex topic. Rather than trying to cover them here, you can learn the basics fairly quickly through <a href="https://github.com/ziishaned/learn-regex/blob/master/README.md">this guide</a>.</p>
       <p>Regexp filters need not match the full path like wildcard type filters, but will apply when they match any part. The filter</p>
       <pre><code>t-shirt</code></pre>
       <p>-would match any of the paths in the first example, but would also match any other path including the text ‘t-shirt’ at any point.</p>
