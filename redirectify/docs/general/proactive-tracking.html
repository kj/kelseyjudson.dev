      <h1>Proactive tracking</h1>
      <p>Proactive tracking is enabled for all shops using Redirectify. Proactive tracking works by reacting to actions performed by the store owner in the Shopify admin. When a relevant action occurs, a path or paths are added to Redirectify proactively â€“ giving you the chance to act before they become an issue for customers.</p>
      <p>The following actions will result in paths being created in Redirectify:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>When a collection is deleted, create a path for /collections/<strong>collection-handle</strong></li>
      <li>When a product is deleted, create paths for /products/<strong>product-handle</strong> and /collections/<strong>all-collection-handles</strong>/products/<strong>product-handle</strong></li>
      <li>When a page is deleted, create a path for /pages/<strong>page-handle</strong></li>
      <li>When a blog is deleted, create paths for /blogs/<strong>blog-handle</strong> and /blogs/<strong>blog-handle</strong>/<strong>blog-post-handle</strong></li>
      <li>When a blog post is deleted, create a path for /blogs/<strong>blog-handle</strong>/<strong>blog-post-handle</strong></li>
      <li>When a product handle is changed, create paths for /collections/<strong>all-collection-handles</strong>/products/<strong>product-handle</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>For all other cases, importing a path into Redirectify is unnecessary as Shopify itself automatically creates a redirect. For example, when a collection is deleted, all product URLs within the collection will redirect to /products/<strong>product-handle</strong>. .</p>
