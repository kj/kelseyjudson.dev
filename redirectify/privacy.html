<h1>Privacy Policy for Redirectify</h1>
<p>Redirectify <strong>‘the App’</strong> provides redirect features <strong>‘the Service’</strong> to
merchants who use Shopify to power their stores. This privacy policy describes
how personal information is collected, used, and shared when you install or use
<strong>the App</strong> in connection with your Shopify-supported store.</p>
<h2>Personal information the App collects</h2>
<p>When you install <strong>the App,</strong> we are automatically able to access certain types
of information from your Shopify account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Merchant information (full name, contact email, etc.)</li>
<li>Un/published blog articles</li>
<li>Un/published collections</li>
<li>Un/published pages</li>
<li>Un/published products</li>
<li>URL redirects</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not store any personally identifiable information of either you or your
customers on our servers when you install the app.</p>
<h2>How do we use your personal information?</h2>
<p>We may use personal information accessible to us via Shopify in order to
communicate with you; providing support, or information about <strong>the App.</strong></p>
<h2>Sharing your personal information</h2>
<p>We will not share personal information of you or your customers with any third
party unless strictly required to enable us to provide <strong>the Service.</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we may also share your personal information to comply with applicable
laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful
request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for
example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory
reasons.</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
