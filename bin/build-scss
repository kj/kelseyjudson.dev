# The sass NPM package is Dart Sass compiled to JavaScript, which is much slower
# than the sass executable which bundles the Dart VM. Unfortunately, the name
# conflicts with the obsolete Ruby version, which a lot of software still uses,
# so we check for a dart-sass executable.
#
# If the NPM package ever bundles the Dart VM (like the GitHub releases), then
# that can be used instead.
