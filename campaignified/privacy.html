      <h1 id="privacy-policy-for-campaignified">Privacy Policy for Campaignified</h1>
      <p>Campaignified <strong>‘the App’</strong> provides an integration with Campaign Monitor for subscribing customers <strong>‘the Service’</strong> to merchants who use Shopify to power their stores. This privacy policy describes how personal information is collected, used, and shared when you install or use <strong>the App</strong> in connection with your Shopify-supported store.</p>

      <p>When you install <strong>the App,</strong> we are automatically able to access certain types of information from your Shopify account:</p>
      <ul>

      <li>Customer orders</li>
      <li>Un/published collections</li>

      </ul>
      <p>Additionally, we collect the following types of personal information from you and your customers once you have installed <strong>the App:</strong> information about you and others who may access <strong>the App</strong> on behalf of your store, such as your name and email address; information about individuals who visit your store, such as their name, email address, and order information (amount spent, products ordered, shipping address, etc.).</p>
      <p>We collect personal information through your Shopify account when a customer signs up for a store account, or completes an order.</p>
      <h2 id="how-do-we-use-your-personal-information">How do we use your personal information?</h2>
      <p>We use the personal information we collect from you and your customers in order to provide <strong>the Service</strong> and to operate <strong>the App.</strong> Additionally, we may use this personal information in order to communicate with you; providing support, or information about <strong>the App.</strong></p>
      <h2 id="sharing-your-personal-information">Sharing your personal information</h2>
      <p>We share the personal information of your customers with Campaign Monitor in order to provide <strong>the Service,</strong> subscribing customers to a mailing list of your choice. We will only share the personal information of customers who specifically indicate that they accept marketing material from your Shopify store.</p>
      <p>Finally, we may also share your personal information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.</p>
