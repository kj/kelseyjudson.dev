      <h1>Getting started with Campaignified</h1>
      <p>Getting up and running with Campaignified is extremely easy. All you need is a Shopify store and a Campaign Monitor account.</p>
      <p>First, either install the app through the <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/campaignified">Shopify App Store</a>, or visit <a href="https://campaignified.lucidapps.nz" class="uri">https://campaignified.lucidapps.nz</a> and enter your shop domain (e.g. ‘example.myshopify.com’).</p>
      <p>Once you’ve authenticated Campaignified with your Shopify store, you will need to do the same for your Campaign Monitor account. Click ‘Link Campaign Monitor’, then ‘Allow’ and you should be redirected back to Campaignified.</p>
      <p>All that’s left is to select a list for Campaignified to sync your customers to.</p>
      <p>Note that you should take careful consideration in selecting your list as when you click confirm, all of your existing customers will be synced to your chosen list. In most cases, it is best to create a new ‘Campaignified’ list in Campaign Monitor to avoid polluting any existing list. Campaignified will handle this automatically if you select ‘[default]’ (recommended).</p>
      <p>Select your client (in most cases, there will only be one option—yourself). When Campaignified has finished retrieving your lists, select a list, and when you’re sure, click confirm to lock in your selection.</p>
      <p>That’s all there is to it! Sit back and let Campaignified do the rest!</p>
