*Campaign Monitor* has some great documentation on [how to manage lists and set
up segments](https://help.campaignmonitor.com/list-segmentation). This is not
handled by our *Campaignified* app.

They also have a lot of info around [creating and managing subscriber
lists](https://help.campaignmonitor.com/category-lists-and-subscribers).

For more info on how *Campaignified* and *Campaign Monitor* work together, take
a look at this article: [What is the difference between Campaignified and
Campaign Monitor?](http://help.lucid.co.nz/campaignified-shopify-app/general/what-is-the-difference-between-campaignified-and-campaign-monitor)
