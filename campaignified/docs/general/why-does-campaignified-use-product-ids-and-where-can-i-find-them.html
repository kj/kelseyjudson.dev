      <h1>Why does Campaignified use product IDs and where can I find them?</h1>
       <p>Product IDs are more reliable than names, as they are unique to a product and never change. Whereas a name might change, an ID will remain the same. The other reason we use product IDs is that names are variable in length. IDs on the other hand are of a consistently short length which allows us to squeeze more into Campaign Monitor’s 250 character limit on custom fields.</p>
       <p>Don’t worry though, product IDs are easy to find! Just find your product in the Shopify admin. The address bar should end in ‘…/products/123456789’, and the number here is your product ID.</p>
