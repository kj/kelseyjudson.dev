      <h1>How do I set up email campaigns and manage segments and lists?</h1>
<p><em>Campaign Monitor</em> has some great documentation on <a href="https://help.campaignmonitor.com/list-segmentation">how to manage lists and set up segments</a>. This is not handled by our <em>Campaignified</em> app.</p>
<p>They also have a lot of info around <a href="https://help.campaignmonitor.com/category-lists-and-subscribers">creating and managing subscriber lists</a>.</p>
<p>For more info on how <em>Campaignified</em> and <em>Campaign Monitor</em> work together, take a look at this article: <a href="http://help.lucid.co.nz/campaignified-shopify-app/general/what-is-the-difference-between-campaignified-and-campaign-monitor">What is the difference between Campaignified and Campaign Monitor?</a> e-between-campaignified-and-campaign-monitor)</p>
