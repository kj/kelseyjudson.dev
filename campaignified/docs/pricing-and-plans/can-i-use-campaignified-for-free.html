      <h1>Can I use Campaignified for free?</h1>
<p>Yes, with a free account, Campaignified will sync each customer’s name and email address to your chosen list. More detailed customer data with custom fields is available to those on a paid plan.</p>
<p>When you first install Campaignified, you will have the opportunity to sign up to the Premium plan with a 14 day trial. At just $9 per month, the Premium plan offers a range of extra custom field data which allows you to create targeted campaigns using Campaign Monitor’s list segments.</p>
<p>You may downgrade at any time before the trial ends and you will not be charged a cent. However, if you’re sure you won’t need the extra features provided with Premium, you may also bypass the trial and start immediately on the free plan.</p>
<p>You can upgrade or downgrade your account plan at any time.</p>
