When you first set up Campaignified, the app performs an initial batch import of
any customers who have 'accepts marketing' set to true. The default for a batch
import in Campaign Monitor is to *not* trigger any subscription-based
autoresponders, and Campaignified respects this default as—for obvious
reasons—it is not ideal to send customers a welcome message out of the blue
following an action that they did not initiate!

Rest assured, that any customers subscribing after this initial import should
trigger any welcome messages correctly.
