Due to the nature of Campaignified, we recommend disabling the ability for
subscribers to edit their subscription preferences. As Campaignified is
push-only (we only sync from Shopify to Campaign Monitor and not vice versa),
any adjustments a user makes to their subscription (other than unsubscribing of
course!) is likely to be overwritten by Campaignified the next time their
information is synced.

In most templates, this will show up as an 'Update Preferences' link. To disable
this feature, in the template editor uncheck 'Edit Subscription' under 'Sharing
and Social'.
