      <h1>What happens when I ‘unlink’ my Campaign Monitor account?</h1>
      <p>When you unlink your Campaign Monitor account, Campaignified will stop syncing customers to your chosen list, and remove all references to your account.</p>
      <p>Unlink your account only if you would like to switch to a list on another Campaign Monitor account, or if you’d like to disable Campaignified.</p>
