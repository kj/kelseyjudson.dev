      <h1>Why has my custom field data been truncated?</h1>
      <p>Unfortunately Campaign Monitor custom field values only allow for a maximum of 250 characters. In most cases this is plenty, but if a value exceeds this length (such as an excessively long list of customer tags), then Campaign Monitor will truncate it to 250 characters.</p>
