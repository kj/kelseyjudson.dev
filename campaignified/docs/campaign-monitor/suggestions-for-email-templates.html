       <p>Due to the nature of Campaignified, we recommend disabling the ability for subscribers to edit their subscription preferences. As Campaignified is push-only (we only sync from Shopify to Campaign Monitor and not vice versa), any adjustments a user makes to their subscription (other than unsubscribing of course!) is likely to be overwritten by Campaignified the next time their information is synced.</p>
       <p>In most templates, this will show up as an ‘Update Preferences’ link. To disable this feature, in the template editor uncheck ‘Edit Subscription’ under ‘Sharing and Social’.</p>
