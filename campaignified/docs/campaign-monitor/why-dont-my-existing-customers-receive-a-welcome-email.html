      <h1>Why don’t my existing customers receive a welcome email?</h1>
<p>When you first set up Campaignified, the app performs an initial batch import of any customers who have ‘accepts marketing’ set to true. The default for a batch import in Campaign Monitor is to <em>not</em> trigger any subscription-based autoresponders, and Campaignified respects this default as—for obvious reasons—it is not ideal to send customers a welcome message out of the blue following an action that they did not initiate!</p>
<p>Rest assured, that any customers subscribing after this initial import should trigger any welcome messages correctly.</p>
