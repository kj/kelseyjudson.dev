While this is certainly an option, bear in mind that on confirmation of your
selection, Campaignified will subscribe all eligible existing customers to the
selected list, and if you're signed up to a paid plan, will also create the
required custom fields.

In most cases, you'll probably want to keep your existing lists clean, so we
strongly recommend creating a new list specifically for Campaignified.

Campaignified will create a list for you automatically if you select
**\[default\]**.
