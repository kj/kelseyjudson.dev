Yes, with a free account, Campaignified will sync each customer's name and email
address to your chosen list. More detailed customer data with custom fields is
available to those on a paid plan.

When you first install Campaignified, you will have the opportunity to sign up
to the Premium plan with a 14 day trial. At just \$9 per month, the Premium plan
offers a range of extra custom field data which allows you to create targeted
campaigns using Campaign Monitor's list segments.

You may downgrade at any time before the trial ends and you will not be charged
a cent. However, if you're sure you won't need the extra features provided with
Premium, you may also bypass the trial and start immediately on the free plan.

You can upgrade or downgrade your account plan at any time.
