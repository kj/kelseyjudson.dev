Campaignified is an app for the Shopify ecommerce platform, which integrates
Shopify with Campaign Monitor. Campaign Monitor is a separate service designed
for management of email marketing campaigns. If you have an account with both
Shopify and Campaign Monitor, then you can use Campaignified to automatically
subscribe your Shopify customers to a subscriber list in Campaign Monitor.

Campaignified is designed to run quietly in the background, so after initial
setup, you can just sit back and let it do its thing! Campaignified does not
provide an admin interface for creating campaigns or otherwise managing your
Campaign Monitor account through Shopify. These tasks are still carried out
through Campaign Monitor itself. For convenience, Campaignified provides a link
to your Campaign Monitor account in the navigation bar, titled 'CM'.

While the name and design are similar, Campaignified and Campaign Monitor are
separate services, supported by two separate companies.
