Product IDs are more reliable than names, as they are unique to a product and
never change. Whereas a name might change, an ID will remain the same. The other
reason we use product IDs is that names are variable in length. IDs on the other
hand are of a consistently short length which allows us to squeeze more into
Campaign Monitor's 250 character limit on custom fields.

Don't worry though, product IDs are easy to find! Just find your product in the
Shopify admin. The address bar should end in '.../products/123456789', and the
number here is your product ID.
